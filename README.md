# Fault-Calculations

To develop the MATLAB program for distance protection typical line data is considered for 400kV line. 

Zone1 protection for Phase to Earth and Phase to Phase characteristic is drawn and tested.

Typical network with double circuit protected line is shown above. 



Line:		Substation-A to Substation-B

Frequency: 	50Hz

Line data: 	R1+jX1 = 0.0288 + j0.307 Ω/km;                     R0 + jX0 = 0.2689 + j1.072 Ω/km
   
Line length: 	190km

CT ratio: 	1000/1A

CVT ratio: 	400/0.11kV
